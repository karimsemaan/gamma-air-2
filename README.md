Gamma Air is all about connecting airlines to pilots and customers. Airlines alert us of flights that they want us to fill, and we provide qualified pilots, and excited customers for the flights. We also have positions called customer representatives, who handle the customer and pilot experiences with care, answering questions from customers, assigning pilots to flights, and shifting pilots around to make flight schedules work for everybody!

Our project is structured around three main users:

# [1] Pilots:

Pilots are contractors that sign on with the company, much like uber, to fly the planes that airlines put on our program. These pilots have to pass background checks and other various important bookkeeping steps, but by the time they hit our database they are fully qualified and ready to fly! These pilots are assigned flight schedules, and have the ability to request changes and adjustments as necessary. Beyond that, they are responsible for showing up to flights on time, and getting good rest between flights!

# [2] Customers:

Customers are everyone! Anyone needing a flight comes to us. Customers have a wide range of airports, planes, pilots, seat types, accomodations, and other ways to customize their ticket to their needs. We provide for every customer as best we can, offering room for comments and additional accomodations when booking tickets, so that our flight staff is prepared for the needs of everyone onboard. Customers also have the opportunity to speak to their assigned support representative (a customer representative!) and ask questions of them about our services, the flights, the pilots, and anything else they might think of!

# [3] Customer Representatives:

Customer representatives are responsible for managing the customers and pilots, keeping their experience as smooth as possible! They answer questions from customers, handle schedule requests from pilots, and assign pilots to flights given to them by our airline partners. Each customer representative has a manager (another customer representative) who they can go to for help if need be.
